# Chess-Game
I have created Chess game board.
I have loaded my pieces in it using SFML.
I have implemented the legal moves of pieces by adding condition checks.
I have created a function to verify "CHECK" condition and display message on the console.
I have also worked on the "CHECKMATE" and "STALEMATE" conditions.
I have made a function to store the score of players and display on the console after every move.
